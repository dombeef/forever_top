# Forever Top
This is a little desktop toy that once you plug the base in, the top spins forever. Its powered off of USB and could last a few days straight if plugged into a usb battery backup.

## How to build
I dont have the room here to say exactly how ive built it, but all you have to do is 3d print the housing(and either polish the top bowl, or fill with some kind of filler like JB Weld, and sand that till its smooth), make the pcb and add the components to it, and wind the coil. 

For the top All you have to do is print out both halves, and fit in roughly 6mm wide magnets. You could modify it to fit any other sized magnets you have laying around.

#### TODO
 [ ] Add better PCB since I created this one to be used as a reference on a perfboard
